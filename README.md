# My Book Library
My Book Library is a simple web application that allows users to create and delete thier favorite books to a Mongo database.

The web application uses React, NextJS, Mongoose, MongoDB and Material UI.

This full stack web application is a learning experience for me. I am slowly teaching myself NextJS, ReactJS, and Material UI and I plan to add more code over time. Hopefully this real world example with improve my programming and web development skills. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you.
